Hey,

After an intense week of learning from scratch: React, Nodejs (express) and MongoDB, integrating all of them into a working app is finally done :)

Here's some instructions for running the App:

Enter the app directory,


#To install dependencies for server run:
npm install

#To install dependencies for client run:
npm run client-install

Then, to run the client & server with concurrently run:
npm run dev

Enjoy!


- Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
